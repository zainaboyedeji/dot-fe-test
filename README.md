## Areas for Improvement

If given more time, I would:

- Optimize image loading by implementing lazy loading to improve performance.
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure all components and features work correctly in various scenarios.
- Enhance filters and pagination by adding more filter criteria and making pagination more customizable.
- Refine the UI to create a more visually appealing and intuitive design.
